Move to form a working group of at least 3 and no more than 5 foundation members (led by 1) to deliver:

- A mission/vision statement for the to-be-built language
- At least 5 and no more than 20 initial user stories to define target user base for the to-be-built language (ex: As a programmer I wish to write code in a language my ops folks on the help desk understand in order to increase our opportunities for collaboration)

The working group will be led by Thomas Rayner supported by Josh King, Mathias RÃ¸rbo Jessen.
Michael Lombardi and Mark Kraus volunteer conditionally on the premise that Joel Sallow and other non-present members do not wish to participate.
