<!--
The suggested workflow of a resolution proposal is as follows:

1. Draft a motion
2. Politic some people into sponsoring it with you
3. Work with sponsors on the wording
4. Freeze the wording
5. Submit to parliamentarian before the deadline
6. Motion is presented
7. Sponsors of the motion attest
8. Discussion/debate
9. Vote

It is suggested that you complete steps 1 - 4 prior to opening an issue. The parliamentarian proposes that step 5 is to create an issue. They will then create the resolution template as a PR to be submitted for the session that the resolution will be discussed/voted on.

Please ensure to fill out the following fields to assist the Parliamentarian in preparing the resolution.
