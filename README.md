# P# Language

P# is a PowerShell based programming language built by the community for the community.

Please note that P# is a working name and not official.
The P# Foundation will select the official name and change it accordingly.

## Background

PowerShell is a Microsoft interactive shell and scripting language created in 2006.
In 2016, Microsoft made the language Open Source.
However, challenges with balancing between Microsoft's needs and Community asks has proven difficult.
The PowerShell Committee, the governing body for the language, is compromised completely of current and former Microsoft Employees.
This leaves the language and many of the core language issues held hostage by a team that is not incentivized to prioritize language needs over business needs.

This project seeks to replace PowerShell with a similar language, but one built from the ground up to be a community programming language first.

## Terms

* P# - The working name for the language.

## FAQs

### Does markekraus own this language?

No.
Everything about this temporary until we get a foundation set up.
The foundation will own everything, and this repo will move to the foundation's GitHub org once created.
Mark's role in this is just boot strap the foundation and move casual conversation to concrete action items.
Mark is more of a facilitator than an owner and his long term involvement in the project is not set in stone.

### Who are the founding members of the foundation?

We are not yet ready to disclose a list of foundation members.
What we can say is that the foundation is made up of well known PowerShell community members whose books, blogs, and presentations many in the community would recognize.
We can also say the the foundation currently doesn't have any PowerShell Committee members.
Mark's involvement makes it obvious that there is at least one Microsoft employee, but no Microsoft employee is servering on the committee as a representative of Microsoft.
We will release the names of the founding members after we formalize the foundation.

### How do I become a foundation member?

Currently, membership is mostly closed until the foundation is formalized.

However, in some cases we may invite additional PowerShell comunity members.
If you are interested in Joining at this early stage, reach out to Mark and he will facilitate possible early membership.
At the moment, we will only be accepting new members who are familiar with starting and operating non profit organizations or are experienced with language steering committees to help boot the foundation.
We will assess adding technical members to the foundation after the foundation is formalized.

### Where can I see foundation communications?

We have a community discord server we are not making public just yet.
We need to set up the foundation and and server to handle the large number of interested users we expect.
We will be making all current and previous conversations publicly viewable in that server.
Our objective isn't to keep things secret, but to ensure we are set up for success before we invite the community at large.
If you are really interested in joining in a read-only fashion, reach out to Mark and he will facilitate that for a limited scopr of community members.

### Will this be a fork of PowerShell?

That is currently up for debate.
We are unsure of the legalities of forking the entire project.
While PowerShell is generally under MIT, this is not true for the entire code base.
Also, we want to take this opportunity to free ourselves from the bonds of the past.
We have a chance now to evaluate if C# is till the right base language and if .NET is still the ideal framework.
Nothing is decided here and it's possible this will looke very much like PowerShell underthe hood, but we don't want to limit ourselves to just forking at this stage.

### What about X/Y/Z language feature/bug/etc?

We are not yet at the stage of discussing these nor are we at the stage of taking community feedback.
We will address tehcnical and engineering concerns after the foundation is formalized.
We want to ensure the right decisioning making frameworks are in place to guide technical decision making.
We are dedicated to making this a community driven programming language and to ensure that, we need those rules in place first.

This is a lesson learned from PowerShell:

If you don't put enough effort into how you organize and incorporate the commmunity up front, you will have a very poor community experience.
